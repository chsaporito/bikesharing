[Tableau Public Citybike Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/christopher.henry.saporito/viz/NYC_Citibike_Challenge_16745072996690/CitybikeStory)
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose this analysis is to create visualizations of the Citybike data that displays the time that bikes are checked out, the number of bike trip sand the genders of the users.
## Results:

```
This Pie Chart shows the proportional breakdown for each gender that make this dataset. 
There are 588,431 females, 1,530,272 males and 225,521 with an unknown gender. 
There 2.6 times more males than females with a difference of 941,841.
```

```
This graph shows the length of time bikes are checked out for all users.
The majority of users check out bikes for approximately 5-6 minute with a smaller
number of checking out bikes for an hour or so.
```

```
This is the same graph as the previous one but shows the breakdown of bike checkouts by gender.
We can also see the large discrepancy of the female/male ratio.
```

```
This heatmap shows the weekday breakdown of checkouts for everyone for each hour.
The color represents the number of bike checkouts with the darker regions representing heavy use and the 
lighter regions representing less use.
```

```
This is the same graph as the previous heat map broken down by gender. Angain we can see the 
disproportionate number of males compare to females.
```

![This is an image](/images/6trips_weekday_type_gender.PNG)
```
This heatmap shows the number of checkouts by user type and gender by the weekday.
We can see that male subscribers are the heaviest users particularly on Thursdays and Fridays.
The unknown gender type appears to have only Customer as its user type with no Subscriber types.
```

![This is an image](/images/avg_trip_duration.PNG)
```
This last graph I made to see what the actual trip duration was based on gender. 
Even though male users have a much higher representation of checkouts, female users take longer rides on average.
The unknown gender type has the longest trip duration average.
```

## Summary: 
The results show a disproportionate number of males compared to females. Males have many more checkouts but females have a higher average ride duration. As we know averages don't tell the whole story. With males having a much larger representation, they will also have a better representation of averages. The higher ride time average for females may level out with more representation.
The unknown gender types are not subscribers, have the lowest number of checkouts but have the highest ride time averages.

I would reccomend charts showing ride duration vs user type and also a location map of gender types and user types.
